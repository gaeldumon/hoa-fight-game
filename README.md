# Hoa Fight

### Local 1v1 shooter-combat game in the browser.

Made with Phaser 3 + Typescript.
Phaser : https://phaser.io/
Typescript : https://www.typescriptlang.org/

Goal is to eliminate the other player while avoiding all the bombs that fall off the sky randomly !
You can choose the terrain and each player can choose their character.
Being hit by a bomb or by the other player result in decreasing your life and your health bar by 20%.

#### Controls :

-   Player 1 : Jump = UP ARROW • Walk left = LEFT ARROW • Walk right = RIGHT ARROW • Shoot = SHIFT
-   Player 2 : Jump = S KEY • Walk left = Q KEY • Walk right = D ARROW • Shoot = SPACE

#### I still have work to do :

-   Handling gamepads
-   Tweening for everything that moves
-   Better bullets trajectories
-   Better UI and general polish
-   Voices for the characters
-   Explosions
-   Bulletproof local storage handling
-   Better terrain, add trampolines

I also made a website using Vue.js, Express and SQL (MariaDB), that is linked to this game, where you can see your stats and ranking of all the players.
